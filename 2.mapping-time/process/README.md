Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.
The PDF contains my 3 sketches. The variables ideas and order are as listed...

    The first page relies on shape and color, the circles will become complete as they reach their intended time.
    colors also help to define which represents hours, minutes, and seconds.

    The second sketch relies on shape, position, and color for understanding. I plan to hav each unique shape represent a single unit of time, and when click they scatter and it will be interesting to see if someone can still read the time.
    
    My third sketch is all about value. When a bar is equal to 0, it is white, when it is full it turns black. the value will act as gradients to tell time. Each bar represents something, minute, hour, second. value will change according to speed of time.
